# card_augmentation
This repo keeps a script that helps you to automatically run data augmentation for TCG's like Pok√©mon.

2. When step one is done make yourself familiar with the .env.example file and fill out everything as needed like folder path of the images etc. After that rename to the file to ".env".
3. Check within the python script if the class_id is references correct. In my .json example it was the "model_class_id" but it
